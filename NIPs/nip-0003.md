[nem2-docs](https://nemtech.github.io/concepts/transaction.html)
The document of nem catapult was submitted. In thid documentation, this state is described.

> How many XEM costs announcing the transaction. The higher the fee, the higher the priority of the transaction. Transactions with high priority get included in a block before transactions with lower priority.

This means the higher fees users show, the faster confirmers(harvestors) confirm, like mining in bitcoin.
This system should be abolished. I describe reasons.
The conclusion is "Fee should be fixed at the level which can make the blockchain secure."
Please save this in the edge of your brain.

### Confirmers' motivation

Transactions will be put in the block.
In the above image, transactions are not full.
Tn this situation, will the confirmer ignore some transactions?
The answer is no. Additional cost of confirming transaction is very low, so the confirmer will confirm all transactions as long as transactions are not full.

Next, imagine the situtation that transactions are full and some transactions are overflown.

Tn this situation, will the confirmer ignore some transactions?
The answer is that, he or she will confirm transactions in order of transaction fees, and overflown transactions are remained.

If you understood confirmers' motivation, you can understand next section smoothly.

### Users' motivation

Imagine the situation which transactions are not full again.

In this situation, how much fee will the users show?
The answer is that, everyone will show the lowest fees.
This is because the confirmer will confirm every transactions in a not full block.

How about in a full block?
The answer is clear.
Users who want to transfer rapidly will show high fees.
On the other hand, users who can be patient with slow transfers will show low fees.

### Traffic jam
![](https://yu-kimura.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f5d050b4e8dcb83386f4f136b86e2763.png)
If blocks are full, users are imposed either of
- high fees for rapid transfers
- slow transfers for low fees
Both of them have "minus" utility.
So, this traffic jam should be removed.

Then, let's remove the traffic jam.
The ways are, for example, big-block, segwit, and so on.

wow. The traffic jam was removed.
But... no user show high fees becaus blocks are not full.

And... some node can't make profits by mining, minting, or harvesting, so some of them withdraw.
This is a bad result.

The selections we can select in the time when the traffic jam was occured are,
1. remove the traffic jam
2. leave the traffic jam
But, 1. was done and lead to a bad result.
So, we can select only 2.
If we adopt floating fee system, we have to leave the traffic jam as a necessary evil.
(If we adopt fixed fee system, we can remove the traffic jam without the nodes withdrawing)

### A littlebit clever man says...
A littlebit clever man says
"The reason why the nodes withdraw is that the lowest fee is too low. So, how about adopting floating fees system with not too low lowest fees?"
good.
This opinion captures the real.
-----
Some opinions don't capture the real.
For example..."The process of determing the fixed fee must be centralized, so we should adopt floating fees!"
The result of this opinion impose us the traffic jam.
-----

So now I show the result of adopting the littlebit clever man's opinion

![](https://yu-kimura.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/f5d050b4e8dcb83386f4f136b86e2763.png)

As a result, everyone shows the lowest(in the range) fee.

However, please consider it carefully.
This result is same to the fixed fee system!
(same to the fixed fee system which fix the fee to the lowest fee in above system)

But, only one point is different.

If the traffic jam problem occured again,
![](https://yu-kimura.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/5ba897d6d697425ab4b38f14e988b482.png)

Because traffic jam make confirmers be able to make more profits, confirmers have a incentives to keep the traffic jam.

On the other hand, in the fixed fee system, everyone in the blockchain include confirmers make the consensus that the traffic jam should be removed, unanimously.

So, NEM should adopt fixed fee system.

### Economics
With the not full block, market principle can't work.
